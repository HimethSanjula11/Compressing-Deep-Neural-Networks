AlexNet INT16-Simulation Quantization-Aware Training - Comprehensive Analysis
===========================================================================

APPROACH EXPLANATION:
This analysis uses INT16-simulation QAT, which employs enhanced precision training
techniques to achieve better quantization quality than standard INT8 QAT, while
ultimately producing INT8 quantized models compatible with standard hardware.
The training process simulates higher precision to reduce quantization error.
